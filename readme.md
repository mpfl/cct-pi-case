This is a work-in-progress. Not everything lines up right just yet.

Printing
--------

Layer height: 0.2mm
Infill: 10%
Supports: No
Raft: No

Finishing
---------

1. Attach the top of the case to your print using the four M3 mounting holes on the left or right gantry, or with zip ties to the unused z-limit switch mounting holes on the right gantry.

2. Place Pi, with the CPU facing the case, inside the case you have mounted.

3. Place bottom of the case over the Pi, lining up the screw holes.

4. Fasten case shut with M2.5 bolts or screws. Larger bolts will damage the PCB on your Pi.
